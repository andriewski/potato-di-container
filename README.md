# Let's plant some potatoes

![alt text](docs/planting-potatoes.jpg)

It's educational project that show people how might the simplest DI container work

So-called **@Bean**'s are substituted with **@Potato**

It's based on the assumption that for _potato_ creation No-args constructor is presented and _potato-injection_ is done
by direct field injection

Just FYI: field injection is an anti-pattern, everything is done just for educational sake

Example of usage you can find in **tests** folder
